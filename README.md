# Templated Wallet Challenge 2:
## Crypto Wallet Dashboard

If you hit the `Run` button, you will see a preview of a live wallet dashboard. If you press `Get Wallet Balance!` in the wallet dashboard, you should see all the token balances for a provided wallet. However, the app is broken and your task is to fix all the bugs to make this app work!

**Challenge Objectives:**

[x] 1. Fix the bugs in `index.html` and `script.js` so that the app runs to display all the balances in a provided wallet address.
 [x] 1.1 Add error handling

[x] 2. This wallet is pretty bare. Customize it with your own styling applied using some basic CSS or Bootstrap for example.

## Task 1: Bug Fixes

If you select files `index.html` and `script.js`, you will notice comments (in green) describing the code fixes needed. **All the fixes require you to replace `#code` with the correct code**. 

There 6 fixes in total. Once all the fixes are made, you should see a table with your Fantom wallet balance from the first challenge when you select the `Fantom-Opera Testnet`.


## Task 2: Custom styling

The second task is to update your Wallet Dashboard with some custom styling. 

&nbsp;
1. Update the `style.css` to customize this wallet with your own background. If you have some HTML/CSS experience, feel free to customize the wallet as much as you like.

&nbsp;
2. Tweet a screenshot of your customized wallet and include the hastags: `#OneMillionWallets`, `#CovalentAPI`, `@IOVLabs`

&nbsp;
3. [Complete this Typeform](https://covalenthq.typeform.com/to/fWFslTSD) and select `Challenge 2` as the challenge.
